          Indigenous Truthtelling Project brings together past and ongoing legacies of resistance to colonialism and a commitment to indigenous knowledge keepers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project seeks to educate about indigenous resistance movements that may be separated by language and geography, but are united in their struggle in the face of colonial oppression, ethnic cleansing, genocide, scholasticide and other expressions of systemic racism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have created sites of engagement for the public to use, to commemorate, honor, memorialize and mourn our heroic martyrs: journalists, educators, writers and poets.
        </p>
        <p>
          We honor their memory through various forms of creative expression, recognizing the ongoing struggles of indigenous people around the world, including indigenous residents of Turtle Island and the Palestinian shatat, diaspora, as well as their co-strugglers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that teachers, educators, students, laity, community members and people of conscience will share and educate others with these artistic pieces, poems and mosaics.
