She also co-hosts and produces shows and podcasts as part of Pacifica Radio’s Radio Intifada on KPFK.",

        name: "Jenna Wilson",
        description: "Jenna Wilson is PhD student in the English Department at UC Riverside with a Master’s in Gender Studies from San Diego State University. Grounded in critical prison studies and speculative archive studies, her work explores contemporary U.S. literary and cultural productions that imagine carceral abolition. More specifically, she is interested in texts that destabilize the temporal schemas of Western capitalist, colonial order and disengage with the logics of the state to render themselves ungovernable. Jenna’s work challenges the rigid boundaries between carceral and non-carceral spaces, illuminating the diffuse geographies of the carceral state and the insurgent practices that emerge in its cracks. She pays particular attention to texts, objects, and  practices that encourage a productive and speculative questioning of the archive. Jenna is also a member of several abolitionist collectives and organizations in southern California that work toward collective liberation, including Graduate Students for Justice in Palestine at UCR. Jenna was the Artistic Project Director who generated the mosaics alongside several Palestinian UCR Alumni and volunteers. ",
